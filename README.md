# To-do list RESTful API server

A RESTful API server for a to-do list app written in Go.

## Motivation

- I like using to-do list apps like Todoist to manage my tasks.
- I don't like having to pay for to-do list apps.
- I want to keep learning Go by building projects.
- I want to further refine my Neovim development setup.
